It is  sensible to have a close look at a potentially powerful technology such as artificial intelligence: this should include both the positive and the less positive sides. Here we go.
<h2>  risks of artificial intelligence</h2>
<h3> 1. A lack of transparency
</h3>
<p> Many AI systems were built with so-called neural networks serving as the engine; these are complex interconnected node systems. However, these systems are less capable of indicating their ‘motivation’ for decisions. You only see the input and the output. The system is far too complex. Nevertheless, where military or medical decisions are involved, it is important to be able to trace back the specific data that resulted in specific decisions. What underlying thought or reasoning resulted in the output? What data was used to train the model? How does the model ‘think’? We are currently generally in the dark about this.

</p>
<h3> 2. Biased algorithms
</h3>
<p> When we feed our algorithms data sets that contain biased data, the system will logically confirm our biases. There are currently many examples of systems that disadvantage ethnic minorities to a greater degree than is the case with the white population. After all, when a system is fed discriminatory data, it will produce this type of data. Garbage in, garbage out. And because the output is from a computer, the answer will tend to be assumed to be true. (This is based on the so-called automation bias, which is the human tendency to take suggestions from “automated decision-making systems” more seriously and ignore contradictory data created by people, even if it is correct). And when discriminatory systems are fed new discriminatory data (because that is what the computer says) it turns into a self-fulfilling prophecy. And remember, biases are often a blind spot.

</p>
<p> Companies still have too little expertise at their disposal to be able to properly assess these data sets and filter out any assumptions and biased data. The most vulnerable groups are disadvantaged by these systems even more than usual. Inequality will increase. In the worst-case scenario, algorithms will choose the winners and the losers. It is similar to the talking sorting hat from the Harry Potter film: nobody knows exactly what happens inside, but you will just have to accept the truth.

  Nonsense? Many convicts have been sentenced by a non-transparent and technically incorrect system, while predictive policing disadvantages the vulnerable in society.
  
  And how can we ascertain that our data sets (on which we rely to an ever greater extent) are not contaminated on purpose by hostile governments or other parties with malicious intent?

<h3> 3. Liability for actions
</h3>
<p> A great deal is still unclear about the legal aspects of systems that become increasingly smart. What is the situation in terms of liability when the AI system makes an error? Do we judge this like we would judge a human? Who is responsible in a scenario in which systems become self-learning and autonomous to a greater extent? Can a company still be held accountable for an algorithm that has learned by itself and subsequently determines its own course, and which, based on massive amounts of data, has drawn its own conclusions in order to reach specific decisions? Do we accept an error margin of AI machines, even if this sometimes has fatal consequences?

</p>
<h3> 4. Too big a mandate
</h3>
<p> The more smart systems we use, the more we will run into the issue of scope. What is the extent of the mandate we give our smart virtual assistants? What are and aren’t they allowed to decide for us? Do we stretch the autonomy of smart systems ever further or should we stay in control of this at any cost, such as is preferred by the European Union? What do and don’t we allow smart systems to determine and implement without human intervention? And should a preview function perhaps be installed in smart AI systems as standard? The risk exists that we transfer too much autonomy, without the technology and preconditions being fully developed, and without us remaining aware over time where we have outsourced the relevant tasks and for what reason. Indeed, there is a risk that we increasingly end up in a world we no longer understand. We must not lose sight of our interpersonal empathy and solidarity as there is a real risk we leave difficult decisions (e.g. employment dismissal) to ‘smart’ machines too easily because we consider this to be too difficult ourselves.

</p>
<h3>5. Too little privacy <h3/>
  <H5>
 <p>
  We create 2.5 quintillion bytes of data each day (which is 2.5 million terabytes, where 1 terabyte is 1,000 gigabyte). Of all digital data in the world, 90 per cent has been created in the last two years. A company requires substantial amounts of pure data to allow for the proper functioning of its smart systems. Apart from high-quality algorithms, the strength of an AI system also lies in having high-quality data sets at one’s disposal. Companies that are involved in artificial intelligence are increasingly turning into Greedy Gus when it comes to our data: it is never enough and anything is justified to achieve even better results. The risk, for example, is that companies create an ever more clearly defined profile of us with ever greater precision, and that these resources are also used for political purposes.

  The result is that our privacy is being eroded. However, when we subsequently protect our personal privacy, said companies will simply use similar target groups; people that look very much like us. And our data is resold en masse, with an increasing loss of awareness as to who receives it or for what purposes it is being used. Data is the lubricating oil of AI systems and our privacy is at stake in any event.
</p>
<p> And not unimportantly: technology will have eyes to see. Cameras can easily be fitted with facial recognition software. Our gender, age, ethnicity and state of mind can be measured with smart software. This is not the future, this type of software already exists. A dynamic advertising billboard in the Dutch city of Utrecht was switched off because the spy software installed on these billboards had given rise to public outrage. Face, voice, behaviour and gesture analysis also results in ever more clearly defined profiles. The use of smart cameras allows for real-time profiling. Smart systems are better able to determine our state of mind than our partner or family members. This is not something from the future: this already exists. And it is readily and generally available as open source software. The government is happy, businesses are happy. Bye privacy.

  A number of these options have been introduced in China. Some police officers wear glasses with facial recognition technology featuring a database with facial pictures of thousands of ‘suspects’. However, bear in mind that you are easily labelled a suspect in China when you make certain political statements in public. A so-called social credit system already exists in China: a rating system where you are judged on the basis of certain behaviour. People with higher scores receive privileges. In addition, the country has a very extensive network of surveillance cameras with image recognition or facial recognition software.

  <h3> 6. Artificial superintelligence
  </h3>
  <p> I personally believe the debate about the drawbacks of artificial intelligence is dominated a little too often by the discussion on superintelligence. The latter refers to systems with an intelligence that far surpasses human intelligence in several respects. As a result, they are able to acquire all manner of skills and expertise without human intervention, they can train themselves for situations unknown to them and are able to understand context. They are a kind of super intelligent oracle that only regards human beings as ‘snails in the garden’: as long as they do not bother you, they are allowed to live.

    First of all, I believe we should take this scenario seriously and we should primarily focus on conveying our ethical morals to intelligent systems. In other words, we should not teach them rules set in stone, but something about human considerations. This is very important. It would be best if we provided them with a ‘conscience’, otherwise they would become anti-social personalities. What I intend to say is that I do not believe we will see even the slightest hint of a consciousness in these systems in the short term. The technology is far too young for this – if it is possible at all to create consciousness in these systems. It is therefore perfectly fine to reflect on it and we should really take superintelligence seriously, but there are certainly other risks at issue now.
    
  </p>
<p> Lest I forget, I would like to add a nuance here. I am not that concerned about a system endowed with any form of consciousness that will take over the world. But… we will probably be affected far more often by systems programmed with a certain objective that they intend to pursue relentlessly, without taking into account issues we consider to be important as humans, including empathy and social equality. Simply because they are programmed this way. Because what we consider to be important is their blind spot. And that is NOT science fiction.

  Facebook is a ‘great’ example of how an artificial intelligence system can have a completely negative result. Indeed, increasingly smart Facebook algorithms only have one goal: keeping you on the platform for as long as possible. Creating maximum involvement with the content. Collecting clicks and reactions. But the system is insensitive to issues such as ‘the objective factual representation of matters’. Truth is unimportant because the system is only interested in the time you spend on the platform. Facebook does not care about the truth, with all the harmful consequences this entails.
